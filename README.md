# dominoes
Simple dominoes game in python using the terminal.  This was created as part of the JetBrains python course.  Ofcourse it could be improved a lot, but I got what I needed out of it and will move onto more complex projects.

download .py file and navigate to the directory.
run the .py file using python3 in the Terminal

game is self explanatory and has instructions and prompts during gameplay.
